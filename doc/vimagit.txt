1. INTRODUCTION                                           *vimagit-introduction*

vimagit is a plugin which try to mimic the fantastic magit emacs plugin. If you
already know the original plugin, give it a try. If you never have heard about
magit (or maybe emacs), this is IMO the most efficient way to stage hunks and
craft nice commits.

===============================================================================
2. INSTALLATION                                           *vimagit-installation*

The plugin hierarchy tree respects the vim plugin standard. It is compatible
with pathogen (and most probably vundle).

To install:
>
  cd ~/.vim/bundle
  git clone https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit
<

===============================================================================
3. TL;DR                                                         *vimagit-TL;DR*

This is the minimal required set of command you must know to start playing
with vimagit. See |vimagit-commands| for a complete description.

  :Magit
-----------

Open magit buffer.

  Enter
-----------

All files diffs are hidden by default. To inspect changes in a file, move
cursor to the filename line, and press 'Enter' in Normal mode. Diffs are
displayed below the file name.

  S
-----------

* Modify a file, for example foo.c, in your repository.
* Move the cursor the line 'modified: foo.c' in "Unstage changes" section,
  press S in Normal mode: the file is stage, and appears in "Stage changes"
  section.
* Move to the line 'modified: foo.c' in "Stage changes" section, press S in
  Normal mode: the file is unstage, and appears in "Unstaged changes" section.

More about S:

* It works exactely the same for new/renamed/deleted files.
* Stage/unstage by hunk is easy: display file diffs with Enter. If
  diffs are composed of multiple hnuks, move the cursor to a hunk, and press
  'S' to stage/unstage this hunk.

  CC
-----------

Once you have stage all the required changes, press CC. A new section
"Commit message" appears and cursor move to it. Type your commit message, in
Insert mode this time. Once it's done, go back in Normal mode, and CC: you
created your first commit with vimagit!
